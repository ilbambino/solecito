I am trying to learn to generate nice images with [canvas-sketch](https://github.com/mattdesl/canvas-sketch) and this is one of my first tries.

Painting the sun trajectories (altitude in this case only) through the months. This is a work in progress.

# How to run it:

1. Install the npm deps
2. `canvas-sketch sun.js` from your terminal and you can see it in the browser
